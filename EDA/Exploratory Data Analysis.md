## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach used in statistics and data science to analyze data sets, summarize their main characteristics, and uncover patterns, anomalies, or relationships before formal modeling. The primary purpose of EDA is to understand the data's structure, check assumptions, and guide the selection of appropriate statistical models or machine learning algorithms.

The typical steps of EDA are as flollows:

### 1. **Data Collection and Understanding the Context**
   - **Objective**: Understand the purpose of the analysis, the source of the data, and any specific research questions.
   - **Steps**: Identify data sources, gather data, and understand the context around it—such as its origin, relevant variables, and relationships with the problem being solved.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
   - **Objective**: Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling errors or inconsistencies.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Handle missing values**: Decide on techniques such as deletion, imputation, or keeping them based on the proportion of missing values and their potential impact.
     - **Remove duplicates**: Check for and remove any duplicate records that may distort analysis.
     - **Correct data types**: Ensure each column's data type (e.g., integers, dates, categories) is appropriate for analysis.
     - **Outlier detection**: Identify and address outliers, either by capping/extending values or removing them, depending on their relevance and impact on results.
   
### 3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Examine each variable individually to understand its distribution and basic properties.
   - **Steps**:
     - **For numerical variables**: Use descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) and visualizations like histograms, box plots, and density plots to understand the variable’s distribution.
     - **For categorical variables**: Calculate frequency counts and visualize with bar charts or pie charts to explore distribution and dominant categories.

### 4. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Explore relationships between two variables to find potential associations.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Numerical vs. Numerical**: Use scatter plots and correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson, Spearman) to check for linear or nonlinear relationships.
     - **Numerical vs. Categorical**: Use box plots, violin plots, or group means to compare distributions of the numerical variable across categories.
     - **Categorical vs. Categorical**: Use cross-tabulations or heatmaps to examine the association between two categorical variables.

### 5. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Explore complex interactions between multiple variables to gain deeper insights.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Heatmaps and Pair Plots**: Visualize correlations across multiple variables.
     - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can help reduce the complexity and visualize relationships in high-dimensional data.
     - **Advanced Plotting**: Use 3D scatter plots or faceted plotting for deeper insights when dealing with multiple dimensions.

### 6. **Feature Engineering and Transformation**
   - **Objective**: Prepare the data for further modeling by creating meaningful features.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Transformations**: Apply log transformations, scaling, or normalization to address skewed distributions or differing variable ranges.
     - **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding).
     - **Feature Creation**: Create new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., interaction terms, ratios, etc.).

### 7. **Checking Assumptions**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the data meets the assumptions of any statistical methods or machine learning algorithms to be used.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Normality**: Check if data follows a normal distribution using Q-Q plots or the Shapiro-Wilk test, especially if methods assuming normality are to be applied.
     - **Homogeneity of Variance**: Use Levene’s or Bartlett’s test to check if variances across groups are similar.
     - **Linearity and Multicollinearity**: Ensure linearity (for linear models) and check for multicollinearity in predictors using correlation matrices or VIF scores.

### 8. **Summary and Reporting**
   - **Objective**: Document findings from the EDA process, including data quality issues, insights, and potential next steps.
   - **Steps**:
     - Summarize key statistics, relationships, and patterns observed in the data.
     - Highlight any anomalies, potential model features, and limitations noted during EDA.
     - Prepare visualizations and tables to support findings for presentation or documentation.

Through these steps, EDA provides a foundation for understanding data deeply, refining research questions, and guiding the selection of appropriate analytical or modeling techniques.
