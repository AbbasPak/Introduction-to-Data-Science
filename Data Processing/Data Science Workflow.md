## Data processing

Data processing is a crucial stage in data science, involving preparing raw data for analysis or model-building. Properly processed data can improve model performance, aid in better insights, and ensure the integrity of the results. Here’s an overview of the main steps in data processing:

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - **Goal**: Gather data from various sources relevant to the problem.
   - **Types of Data Sources**:
      - **Structured**: Tabular data from databases, spreadsheets.
      - **Unstructured**: Text, images, audio, or video files.
      - **Semi-structured**: Data with some structure, like JSON or XML.
   - **Example**: For a retail analysis, data may come from sales databases, customer feedback, and social media.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
   - **Goal**: Remove or handle inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and missing values to ensure data quality.
   - **Common Cleaning Tasks**:
      - **Handling Missing Values**: Impute missing values with mean, median, or mode; or remove rows with significant missing data.
      - **Removing Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid biased analysis.
      - **Outlier Treatment**: Detect and handle outliers that may skew results.
      - **Standardize Units**: Convert all measurements to a common unit if needed.
   - **Example**: In a housing dataset, filling missing house prices with the median price in the region.

### 3. **Data Transformation**
   - **Goal**: Convert data into a format suitable for analysis or modeling.
   - **Steps in Transformation**:
      - **Scaling**: Apply normalization or standardization to bring all features to a comparable range.
      - **Encoding**: Convert categorical variables to numerical ones (e.g., one-hot encoding).
      - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features from existing data to enrich the dataset.
   - **Example**: Encoding the categories "low," "medium," and "high" in a survey as 1, 2, and 3, respectively, or creating a new feature like "age" from a "birthdate" column.

### 4. **Data Reduction**
   - **Goal**: Reduce the dataset’s size or complexity while retaining relevant information.
   - **Common Techniques**:
      - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to reduce the number of features.
      - **Sampling**: Use a representative subset of the data if the dataset is too large.
      - **Feature Selection**: Choose only the most relevant features for analysis.
   - **Example**: Using PCA to reduce a dataset of 100 features to 20 principal components.

### 5. **Data Integration**
   - **Goal**: Combine data from multiple sources into a single, coherent dataset.
   - **Key Integration Tasks**:
      - **Merging**: Join datasets on a common key (e.g., merging customer information with transaction data).
      - **Concatenating**: Append datasets with similar columns.
      - **Data Warehousing**: Store and manage data from multiple sources in one place.
   - **Example**: Merging transaction records with customer profiles using customer IDs.

### 6. **Data Aggregation and Grouping**
   - **Goal**: Summarize data for analysis, often used in exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - **Methods**:
      - **Aggregating**: Calculate summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, sum) by category.
      - **Grouping**: Split data into groups to analyze relationships.
   - **Example**: Calculating average sales per month or finding the sum of total sales by region.
