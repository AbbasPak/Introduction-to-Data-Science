# Data Science Course - Fall 2024

Welcome to the **Data Science Course** repository for the Fall 2024 semester! This course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to Data Science, covering key concepts, tools, and techniques used in the field. Whether you are a beginner or have some prior experience, this course will help you build a solid foundation and enable you to work on practical projects.

## 📚 Course Structure

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a different aspect of Data Science. You will find the following resources organized in each module folder:

- **Lecture Notes**: Detailed notes covering key concepts and explanations.
- **Notebooks**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks with examples and exercises.
- **Readings**: Supplementary reading materials and references.
- **Exercises**: Hands-on exercises to practice the concepts covered in the lectures.
- **Projects**: Capstone projects to apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios.
  
Each module will focus on a core component of Data Science:
1. **Introduction to Data Science**
2. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
4. **Data Visualization**
5. **Statistical Inference**
6. **Machine Learning Basics**
7. **Supervised Learning**
8. **Unsupervised Learning**
9. **Feature Engineering**
10. **Model Evaluation and Tuning**
11. **Introduction to Deep Learning**
12. **Final Project**

## 🚀 How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repository**: You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-course-fall2024.git
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**: To work with the provided Jupyter notebooks, you will need to set up the necessary environment. We recommend using `conda` or `pip` to install the required dependencies.
   - Install dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Navigating the Modules**: Each module has its own folder with specific materials, exercises, and projects. Follow the order of modules as outlined in the syllabus, and complete the exercises before moving to the next module.

4. **Working with Jupyter Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks will be used throughout the course for coding exercises. You can launch Jupyter by running:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Submitting Assignments**: Each exercise and project folder will include submission instructions. Typically, you’ll be asked to submit your Jupyter notebook solutions via a pull request or directly on the course platform.
