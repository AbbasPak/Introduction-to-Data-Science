- **Exercises**: Hands-on exercises to practice the concepts covered in the lectures.
- **Projects**: Capstone projects to apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios.
  
Each module will focus on a core component of Data Science:
1. **Introduction to Data Science**
2. **Python Basics**
3. **Data Collection and Cleaning**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Data Visualization**
6. **Statistical Inference**
7. **Machine Learning Basics**
8. **Supervised Learning**
9. **Unsupervised Learning**
10. **Feature Engineering**
11. **Model Evaluation and Tuning**
12. **Introduction to Deep Learning**
13. **Final Project**

## ðŸš€ How to Get Started

1. **Clone the repository**: You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-science-course-fall2024.git
   ```

2. **Navigating the Modules**: Each module has its own folder with specific materials, exercises, and projects. Follow the order of modules as outlined in the syllabus, and complete the exercises before moving to the next module.

3. **Working with Jupyter Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks will be used throughout the course for coding exercises. You can launch Jupyter by running:

# How to Install Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is an essential tool for data science, allowing you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Here's how you can install it on your system.

## Option 1: Installing via Anaconda (Recommended)

Anaconda is a popular platform that comes with Jupyter Notebook and a variety of other essential data science libraries pre-installed. This is the easiest way to get started.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Download Anaconda**:
   - Go to the official Anaconda website: [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
   - Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. **Install Anaconda**:
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
   - Make sure to select the option to add Anaconda to your systemâ€™s PATH environment (recommended).

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open Anaconda Navigator (you can search for it in your start menu or applications).
   - From the Anaconda Navigator interface, click on the "Launch" button under Jupyter Notebook.

**Alternatively**, you can launch Jupyter Notebook directly via the command line:
   1. Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
   2. Type:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
      ```
   3. A new tab should open in your default browser with the Jupyter Notebook interface.

## Option 2: Installing via pip (Python's Package Manager)

If you already have Python installed on your system and prefer a lightweight installation without Anaconda, you can install Jupyter Notebook using `pip`.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Install Python and pip**:
   - If you don't already have Python installed, download it from: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - During installation, ensure you check the option to "Add Python to PATH."

2. **Install Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).
   - Run the following command to install Jupyter:
      ```bash
      pip install notebook
      ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Once installation is complete, launch Jupyter Notebook by typing:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
      ```
   - This will start the notebook server and open the Jupyter interface in your web browser.

## Option 3: Using Google Colab (No Installation Required)

If you're looking for a cloud-based solution that doesn't require installation, you can use Google Colaboratory (Colab). Colab allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser with access to various data science libraries, and itâ€™s free to use.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Log in with your Google account.
3. Create a new notebook by clicking on **"New Notebook"**.
4. Start coding! Colab supports many of the same features as Jupyter and is great for collaborative projects.
