## 1.1 What is Data Science?

**Lecture Notes**: 
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on extracting knowledge and insights from data. It combines expertise from various fields including statistics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge. 

Key points covered:
- Data Science definition
- Data Science vs. Data Analytics vs. Machine Learning
- Real-world applications of Data Science (e.g., healthcare, finance, marketing)
- The role of a Data Scientist

**Suggested Reading**:
- "What is Data Science?" (Blog/Article)
- "Data Science in Practice" (Book chapter)

## 1.2 Data Science Workflow

**Lecture Notes**:  
The Data Science workflow is a step-by-step process used by data scientists to work through a data problem. Understanding this workflow is essential as it helps in organizing and structuring data projects.

Key workflow steps include:
1. **Problem Definition**: Understanding the business problem or research question.
2. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data (e.g., from databases, APIs, surveys).
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting errors, etc.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and summarizing the data.
5. **Modeling**: Applying machine learning or statistical models.
6. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model’s performance.
7. **Communication**: Presenting the insights to stakeholders.

**Suggested Reading**:
- "The Data Science Process" (KDnuggets article)
- "The CRISP-DM Methodology" (PDF)

## **Roles in Data Science**
- **Data Scientist**: Responsible for building models and analyzing data.
- **Data Engineer**: Focuses on data infrastructure and pipeline creation.
- **Machine Learning Engineer**: Builds and maintains machine learning models.
- **Data Analyst**: Interprets data and provides insights through reports.
- **Business Analyst**: Bridges the gap between business needs and data insights.

## **Tools and Technologies**
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Big Data Tools**: Hadoop, Spark.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter, Colab for interactive coding.



 **Exercise**:
- Install Python (or Anaconda distribution) and set up your environment.
- Install Jupyter Notebook.
- Install basic libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`.

**Suggested Reading**:
- [Python for Data Science](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- "Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks" (Official Docs)

## 1.4 Setting Up Your Python Environment

**Exercise**: 
1. **Installing Python**: If you don't have Python installed, follow the instructions on how to install Python or the Anaconda distribution.
2. **Jupyter Notebooks**: Install and launch Jupyter notebooks.
    - Example command:
      ```bash
      pip install jupyter
      jupyter notebook
      ```
3. **Installing Data Science Libraries**:
    - Install the libraries that will be used throughout the course:
      ```bash
      pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
      ```
4. **Explore Jupyter Notebook**: Write a basic Python script (e.g., print "Hello, Data Science!") and explore basic operations.

**Exercise Notebook**:
Create a new Jupyter notebook where you:
- Write basic Python operations (print, basic math).
- Import and use basic libraries like `numpy` and `pandas`.

## Summary

This module introduced the fundamentals of Data Science, the typical workflow, and essential tools you'll use throughout the course. You set up your Python environment and performed basic exploratory data analysis using Jupyter Notebooks.

In the next module, we will dive deeper into **Data Collection and Cleaning**, where you’ll learn how to acquire and prepare datasets for analysis.
